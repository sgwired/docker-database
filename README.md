# Docker Setup for MariaDB/PostgreSQL with Adminer

This guide provides instructions to set up a MariaDB or PostgreSQL database instance along with an Adminer web interface using Docker Compose.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your machine
- Docker Compose installed on your machine

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>

2. Configure the Docker Compose File
The docker-compose.yml file is already configured to set up either a MariaDB or PostgreSQL instance along with Adminer. You can uncomment the PostgreSQL section if you prefer to use PostgreSQL.

3. Start the Services
Run the following command to start the services:

docker-compose up -d

This command will start the MariaDB and Adminer containers. If you want to use PostgreSQL, make sure to comment out the MariaDB section and uncomment the PostgreSQL section in the docker-compose.yml file before running the command.

4. Access Adminer
Once the containers are up and running, you can access Adminer through your web browser at:

http://localhost:8080

5. Connect to the Database
For MariaDB:
System: MySQL
Server: mariadb
Username: root
Password: rootpassword
Database: appdb
For PostgreSQL:
System: PostgreSQL
Server: postgres
Username: postgres
Password: somepassword
Database: thedb
6. Stop the Services
To stop the services, run:

docker-compose down

Volumes
The data for the databases is stored in Docker volumes to ensure data persistence. The volumes are defined in the docker-compose.yml file.

Networks
A custom network named adminer-network is used to allow communication between the database and Adminer containers.

Environment Variables
The following environment variables are used to configure the database instances:

MariaDB:
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: Root password for MariaDB
MYSQL_DATABASE: Name of the database to be created
MYSQL_USER: Username for the database
MYSQL_PASSWORD: Password for the database user
PostgreSQL:
POSTGRES_USER: Username for PostgreSQL
POSTGRES_PASSWORD: Password for the PostgreSQL user
POSTGRES_DB: Name of the database to be created
Initial SQL Scripts
Initial SQL scripts can be placed in the ./sql directory. These scripts will be executed when the database containers are first started.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues, check the logs of the containers:

docker-compose logs mariadb
docker-compose logs adminer
# or for PostgreSQL
docker-compose logs postgres
